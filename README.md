# bioacoustic-detection-pipeline

This repository provides an **end-to-end pipeline for bioacoustic species call detection** using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  
It is designed for **weakly supervised detection**, where **only presence calls are fully annotated**, and absence is implicit.

The pipeline is notebook-driven and focuses on audio preprocessing, CNN training,batch prediction, and event-based detection evaluation (PAM-oriented)

## 🧠 Method Overview


1. Audio is segmented into short fixed-length windows  
2. Time–frequency features (e.g. spectrograms or log-mel) are extracted  
3. A CNN is trained to detect the presence of a target species  
4. The trained model is applied to long recordings  
5. Predictions are evaluated using **event-based metrics**, suitable for
   partially annotated bioacoustic datasets  


This approach is well suited for:
- Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM)
- Rare or low-data species
- Presence-only annotations

### 4️⃣ Evaluation  


Purpose:
- Compare predictions with ground-truth annotations
- Compute **event-based detection metrics**
- Visualize detection performance


Metrics include:
- Precision
- Recall (True Positive Rate)
- F1-score
- False Alarms per Hour (FA/h)

## 📊 Evaluation Philosophy


- Only presence calls are fully annotated  
- Absence is treated as implicit background  
- Metrics are computed at the **event level**, not frame level  
- No artificial true negatives are introduced  


This avoids biased accuracy scores and follows best practices in
bioacoustic detection research.
